# Pranshu Khanna

Hey, I'm currently a Community & Events Manager at [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com). I enjoy building, scaling and engaging with communities and enjoy great events and swag.

This is my take home assignment for a position at **Vercel** and I've chosen the Blog Starter Kit to ensure accessibility and make the content readable. This also helps me to write the content on MDX, so it's an easier solution for everyone involved. :D

[**Template Link**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
