# Pranshu Khanna

Hey, I'm a creature in space questioning my existence(not really, we’re in the Matrix). Currently working as the `Community & Events Manager` at [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com). I enjoy building, scaling and engaging with communities and enjoy great events and swag.

I love to talk about Community, Developer Marketing, Education, Mental Health, Neurodiversity, Products, Design and Consumer Electronics.
