# Pranshu Khanna ðŸ‘¾

Hey, I'm a creature in space questioning my existence(not really, weâ€™re in the Matrix). Currently working as the `OSS Community Manager` at #e1[Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/blog/unleash-brings-powerful-constraints-feature-to-oss-users?utm_source=website&utm_medium=pransh). I enjoy building communities and enjoy great events and swag. ðŸ‘•

I love to talk about Community, Developer Marketing, Education, Mental Health, Neurodiversity, Products, Design and Consumer Electronics.
