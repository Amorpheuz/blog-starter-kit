#### 2. What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work?

I'd like to do more of the following:
    1. Code more at work, and do more around web development. Whether it's solving user problems, or creating solutions or usecases myself, I'd like to create a technical aspect to my day-to-day than it is right now.
    2. Be a leader. I often assume ownership with various projects and tasks, and I want to learn how to, and actually lead a team at work.
    3. This is not for work entirely, but I would also like to give more talks because these help me learn at a faster pace and share knowledge. I haven't been able to do a lot of that in my current role, but I would enjoy giving more talks and create more content as well.
