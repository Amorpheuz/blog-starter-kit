Label Issues on GitHub, to help with triaging and better discover for the community.

    Since we are on the topic, I have a suggestion for engagement. This is a very well sorted community, in my opinion. I like the fact that Vercel is not trying to be everywhere, and create so many channels for you to keep track of. Instead of changing anything, I would add more engagement touchpoints for community growth. That could mean a lot of things starting from more engaging discussions on GitHub, Discord and Twitter. Could also host a few giveaways around different frameworks and also build out Ambassador or Influencer Programs, supporting Meetups worldwide, and a few more initiatives. I also believe Vercel can use a /community to point to:

    - Support channels for community users
    - Discord Links for different communities for Frameworks
    - Showcase for innovative community vercel.app usecases/projects
    - Learning Resources
    - Community and Sponsored Events
    - Frontend Meetups we can feature

**How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?**

    I think this is perfect, and covers all the bases for the requirements Vercel has for the role.
