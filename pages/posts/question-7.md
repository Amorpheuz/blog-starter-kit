- I would go ahead and speak with the team and try and figure out a way to check file changes in the root directory. 
- Check what the best way is to do this, since it's a monorepo with 3 projects. I reckon that a script should be okay since the required solution has a criteria for common directory changes.
- I will try and replicate the solution for myself, and if it works, reply with the code.
- I will also let the Product team know of the solution to see if there's a way this can be automated and/or fits in the roadmap for features for any Enterprise or Community customers, if it makes sense.
