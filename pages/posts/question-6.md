##### TL;DR Community means everthing to me!

My journey started as a Community member of a product I loved, and evangelizing for them started out of love, before anything else. The community mentioned is Mozilla's and being a Mozillian gave me a purpose, and a reason to advocate for a product that in my opinion, did the right thing. It also gave me an opportunity to see that not everything is perfect, and voice my opinion on what could be better. That volunteer community journey became a leadership one, as well as a technical one since my major us Electronics & Communications Engineering, and through an Open Source community, I learnt so much more about Web Development and Internet of Things than my college ever taught me.

My early expeditions led me to do the same for my local community with Mozilla Gujarat, where I organized basic Computer skills workshops for underpriveleged children who grew up in a smartphone world but missed out on how to operate on a Computer. This put things in perspective for me while leading my community to more such talks, events, booth crawls and much more. Working with students around me, I saw a huge gap to fill within education that I wanted to solve which motivated me to mentor aspiring engineers like I was and connect them with professionals that can guide them to a better career.

I have built and scaled different communities, and worn various hats in different capacities and I have always enjoyed achieving more together, and communities enable me to do that, as I enable communities.
