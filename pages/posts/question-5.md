You can use your custom domain purchased on GoDaddy with a Vercel project. Vercel allows you to add your custom domains purchased from any provider, to use for your projects on any tier. Make sure you have your GoDaddy's Advanced DNS settings opened up to add A records and CNAME to your domain. 
    
Go to your project in Vercel and under the Domains tab, simply add your domain address. Click on **Add** to and folow the instructions to successfully add your domain to the project. You can find more details in the documentation [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains#adding-a-domain).
