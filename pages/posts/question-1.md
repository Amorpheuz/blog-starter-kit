It's not a lightning talk, but this is one of my favorite talks. Dylan covers a lot of what I learned back in middle school with tools like LOGO, which adds a nostalgic attachment. Since this covers everything I love about code, it's not just logical; it's artistic at the same time.

The talk simply conveys the best of what code can bring beyond solving complex problems. Through art, mathematics, and complex solutions, and understanding the behavior of different systems and how with different iterations, we understand the different irregularities and how code helps you create art within motion pictures, science, and Deep Fakes.
  
A guide that I really enjoy is Josh Comeau's written work on [Building a Magic 3D Button](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/). Going through end-to-end concepts of mimicking physics on a 2D screen - his explanation from Josh is spot-on. The description and the reveal sliders to show precisely how it works is something that impresses me about the lengths Josh goes to explain the process with cubic-bezier and equilibrium curves. Close to the guide menitioned, Delba Olivier's blog on [A like button that likes you back](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back) is also something I enjoyed.
