Thank you for your interest in Vercel! We would appreciate approximately one hour of your time to complete a short familiarisation exercise. 
Before you start, you'll need a GitHub (recommended), GitLab or Bitbucket account. 
~~1. If you haven't already, create a Hobby tier (free) account on Vercel. You can sign up to Vercel by using your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account.~~
> Done ✅

~~2. Create a project on Vercel. You can use our get started guide, documentation and templates for help and inspiration.~~
> Done ✅

3. Complete the following tasks. Add the responses directly to your Vercel project – please do not create a separate document.
Create pages or sections on your project for each question. If you're unable to complete any task, don't worry! Go ahead and explain what information or knowledge may be missing
  1. Which technical article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? Why? Ideally, this article would not be associated with Vercel or web development, by the way! Please provide links.
  > It's not a lightning talk, but this is one of my favorite talks. Dylan covers a lot of what I learned back in middle school with tools like LOGO, which adds a nostalgic attachment. Since this covers everything I love about code, it's not just logical; it's artistic at the same time.

  > The talk simply conveys the best of what code can bring beyond solving complex problems. Through art, mathematics, and complex solutions, and understanding the behavior of different systems and how with different iterations, we understand the different irregularities and how code helps you create art within motion pictures, science, and Deep Fakes.

  > A guide that I really enjoy is Josh Comeau's written work on [Building a Magic 3D Button](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/). Going through end-to-end concepts of mimicking physics on a 2D screen - his explanation from Josh is spot-on. The description and the reveal sliders to show precisely how it works is something that impresses me about the lengths Josh goes to explain the process with cubic-bezier and equilibrium curves. Close to that, I also enjoyed Vercel's own Delba Olivier's blog on [A like button that likes you back](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back).


  2. What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work?
  >  
  3. Add a temporary in-app redirect to your project, redirecting /hello-vercel (or any path – but be sure to tell us which!) to https://vercel.com 
  > Check out [pran.sh/hello-vercel](https://www.pran.sh/hello-vercel)
  4. Imagine a customer reaches out in our GitHub community asking "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond? 
  5. A customer writes in to our GitHub community stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond? 
  6. What does Community mean to you? 
  7. Would, or how would, you improve the response shared with a customer here? 8. What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term? 
  9. If you could make one change to our flagship community, what would it be and why? 
  10. How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise? 
4. Make sure that you have re-deployed the project to reflect your latest changes and that the repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket is public. 
5. Respond to our original email with a link to both your deploy & repository and congratulate yourself on a job well done!
