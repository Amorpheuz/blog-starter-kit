This is my take home assignment for a position at **Vercel** and I've chosen the Blog Starter Kit to ensure accessibility and make the content readable. This also helps me to write the content on MDX, so it's an easier solution for everyone involved. ðŸ˜„

Thank you for your interest in Vercel! We would appreciate approximately one hour of your time to complete a short familiarisation exercise. Before you start, you'll need a GitHub (recommended), GitLab or Bitbucket account. 

~~**1. If you haven't already, create a Hobby tier (free) account on Vercel. You can sign up to Vercel by using your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account.**~~

Done âœ…

~~**2. Create a project on Vercel. You can use our get started guide, documentation and templates for help and inspiration.**~~

Done âœ…

**3. Complete the following tasks. Add the responses directly to your Vercel project â€“ please do not create a separate document.**
**Create pages or sections on your project for each question. If you're unable to complete any task, don't worry! Go ahead and explain what information or knowledge may be missing**

  **1. Which technical article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? Why? Ideally, this article would not be associated with Vercel or web development, by the way! Please provide links.**

    It's not a lightning talk, but this is one of my favorite talks. Dylan covers a lot of what I learned back in middle school with tools like LOGO, which adds a nostalgic attachment. Since this covers everything I love about code, it's not just logical; it's artistic at the same time.

    The talk simply conveys the best of what code can bring beyond solving complex problems. Through art, mathematics, and complex solutions, and understanding the behavior of different systems and how with different iterations, we understand the different irregularities and how code helps you create art within motion pictures, science, and Deep Fakes.

    A guide that I really enjoy is Josh Comeau's written work on [Building a Magic 3D Button](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/). Going through end-to-end concepts of mimicking physics on a 2D screen - his explanation from Josh is spot-on. The description and the reveal sliders to show precisely how it works is something that impresses me about the lengths Josh goes to explain the process with cubic-bezier and equilibrium curves. Close to the guide menitioned, Delba Olivier's blog on [A like button that likes you back](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back) is also something I enjoyed.


  **2. What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work?**

    I'd like to do more of the following:
      1. Code more at work, and do more around web development. Whether it's solving user problems, or creating solutions or usecases myself, I'd like to create a technical aspect to my day-to-day than it is right now.
      2. Be a leader. I often assume ownership with various projects and tasks, and I want to learn how to, and actually lead a team at work.
      3. I would like to be a mentee again. In a lifelong search for knowledge, as I will move again - I would like to learn from mentors. With GraphCMS, I had that too, and with a new role, I am seeking a similar role model to learn more and better.
      4. This is not for work entirely, but I would also like to give more talks. I haven't been able to do a lot of that in my current role.


  **3. Add a temporary in-app redirect to your project, redirecting /hello-vercel (or any path â€“ but be sure to tell us which!) to https://vercel.com **

    Check out [pran.sh/hello-vercel](https://www.pran.sh/hello-vercel). I was using ```permanent: true``` for a few commits before I realized. ðŸ˜…


  **4. Imagine a customer reaches out in our GitHub community asking "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?**

    Vercel (and Next.js) both have the functionality to add Redirects to your application. 
  
    ### Setting up the redirect
      1. Create a ```vercel.json``` file with the code below.
      ```
      {
      "redirects": [
        { 
          "source": "/hello-vercel",
          "destination": "https://vercel.com/", 
          "permanent": false
        }
        ]
      }
      ```
      2. Push the changes and redeploy your application.
    
      Go to ```yourdomain.com/hello-vercel```, and you should get redirected to the 


  **5. A customer writes in to our GitHub community stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?** 

    You can use your custom domain purchased on GoDaddy with a vercel project very easily. Go to your project and under the Domains tab, simply add your domain address and click on Add to see what are the following steps to successfully add your domain to the project.


  **6. What does Community mean to you?**


  **7. Would, or how would, you improve the response shared with a customer here?** 
  
  
  **8. What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?** 


  **9. If you could make one change to our flagship community, what would it be and why?** 


  **10. How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?** 


~~**4. Make sure that you have re-deployed the project to reflect your latest changes and that the repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket is public.**~~

  Done âœ…

~~**5. Respond to our original email with a link to both your deploy & repository and congratulate yourself on a job well done!**~~
