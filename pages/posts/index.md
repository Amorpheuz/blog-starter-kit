This is my take home assignment for a position at **Vercel** and I've chosen the Blog Starter Kit to ensure accessibility and make the content readable. This also helps me to write the content on MDX, so it's an easier solution for everyone involved. ðŸ˜„

Thank you for your interest in Vercel! We would appreciate approximately one hour of your time to complete a short familiarisation exercise. Before you start, you'll need a GitHub (recommended), GitLab or Bitbucket account. 

**1. If you haven't already, create a Hobby tier (free) account on Vercel. You can sign up to Vercel by using your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account.**

  Done âœ…

**2. Create a project on Vercel. You can use our get started guide, documentation and templates for help and inspiration.**

  Done âœ…

**3. Complete the following tasks. Add the responses directly to your Vercel project â€“ please do not create a separate document.**
**Create pages or sections on your project for each question. If you're unable to complete any task, don't worry! Go ahead and explain what information or knowledge may be missing**
